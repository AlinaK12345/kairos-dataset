"""The label: how a post did against its own author's usual level.

    level  = median of log(1 + reactions) over the author's own EARLIER posts, at least 5
    resid  = log(1 + reactions of the post) - level
    class  = below (0) if resid < low, above (2) if resid > high, typical (1) otherwise

`low` and `high` are the 20th and 80th percentiles of the residuals of the train
posts: x0.577 and x3.182 of the author's usual level. The level reads earlier
posts only, so a post never enters the median it is judged against, and the
level of any post can be computed from the posts that precede it.

`python -m kairos.label` recomputes every label from the posts and checks it
against labels.csv.
